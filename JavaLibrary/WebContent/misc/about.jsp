        <b>About</b> 
      </center>
      <p><br>
        <b>Background and Mission </b><br>
        The JSP base library system is a project for my postgraduate study unit 
        - 66415 (Object-OOriented Design), to spearhead the transformation of 
        library services in web base using Java technology in the Information 
        Age. Its mission is to expand the learning capacity flexibility, so as 
        to enhance competitiveness and to promote a gracious society. By developing 
        a relevant and responsive library system, which caters to the needs of 
        its people, the JSP base library system will help in creating enlightened 
        individuals who can compete confidently in all sectors. <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Bringing Libraries Closer to You</b> </p>
      <p>JSP base library system is creating a network of borderless libraries 
        linking all publicly-funded libraries in web environmnet and information 
        services through computer networking. By bringing libraries closer to 
        the public, the JSP base library system places the wealth of knowledge 
        and information within easy reach of all borrower. </p>
      <p>The vast and continually growing collection of books and multimedia materials 
        allows the library to be one of the most extensive warehouses of information. 
        Through its links with local and overseas information databases, the JSP 
        base Library System provides users with global access to information anywhere 
        in the world. </p>
      <p>The JSP base Library System is continually developing and offering new 
        and improved sevices to its diverse users, and expects to realise its 
        goal of becoming a highly respected information hub in the 21st century. 
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>The Logo</b> </p>
      <p>The JSP base Library System is modern, dynamic and innovative in its 
        delivery of library and information services, and this approach is embodied 
        in its logo. The stylised book and flipping pages represent qualities 
        of dynamism and the power of unlimited learning; qualities that promote 
        reading, learning and a continual search for information of all forms. 
        These are qualities that are also the very foundation of the Board's vision 
        of Library 2000. </p>
      <p>The transition from bold solid pages to a pixeled format depicts the 
        evolution from print to electronic media, representing JSP base Library 
        System's current technology focus and its commitment to be at the cutting 
        edge of technological development. It also reflects the integrated computer 
        network system, which allows library users easy, quick access to information 
        and greater convenience in borrowing and returning books. </p>
      <p>The sturdy blocks depict JSP base Library System's range of comprehensive 
        services and facilities that are available at all its libraries. The three 
        pages represent the library system's three-tier concept - regional, community 
        and neighbourhood libraries and the outreach programme to bring information 
        to the doorstep of every household.<br>
